Scraper code needs lxml installed. needs specific distro for whatever version of python your running.
Dowload the file then run pip install in the file directory where it was downloaded
Also need to download beautifulsoup4 using pip install

Link to where to get binary lxml files: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

example: I have python 3.5.2 and AMD and 64 bit therefore I needed lxml‑3.6.4‑cp35‑cp35m‑win_amd64.whl
